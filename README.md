This to play around

Idk what Im doing rn so im playing around
Gimme a few hours

Update: 7:44pm
I forgot to add the initial timing but this ReadME is now officially my record of figuring out how to use GitHub and VSCode so yeah. Here was what I did:
1) Created a branch
2) Created a new py file
3) Committed the new file to the side branch
4) Created a PR for the new branch
5) Merged the new branch to the main branch

But yeah, LETS GOOOOOOOO
